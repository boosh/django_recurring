- Only write code, don't provide any commentary.
- Use British English
- Document functions you write
- For Python:
  - use type hints
    - Use new style type hints, i.e. minimal use of the typing import,
    - no implicit Optionals
  - Favour calling functions with kwargs where possible (except for the stdlib)
  - Do not rewrite existing code to use list comprehensions
  - Only add imports at the top of the file, not part way down
- IF YOU NEED MORE CODE ADDING TO THE CHAT, ASK FOR IT, DON'T JUST GO OFF AND INVENT STUFF
